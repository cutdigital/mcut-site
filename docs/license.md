# Licensing


MCUT is available under an _Open Source license_ as well as a _commercial license_. Users choosing to use MCUT under the free-of-charge Open Source license have to comply to its terms, otherwise they have to buy a commercial license.

The Open Source license is the [GNU General Public License](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html) (GPL).

Below is a brief overview of the license scheme and the rights given to users.

## The Open Source License

The code is released under the GPL in order to protect its commercial value. This allows for commercialisation, which guarantees long term support, maintenance and further developments of the code for the benefit of the project and its users.

**GPL primer**

[GPL](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html) (v3+) is an Open Source license that, gives you the right to use, copy and modify the code freely. 

If you distribute your software based on GPL (i.e. without purchasing the commercial license), then the following applies

* You are obliged to distribute the modifications of MCUT you made, and 
* You are furthermore obliged to distribute the source code of your own software under the GPL.

## The Commercial License

The commercial license also allows MCUT to be used in an unlimited number of products developed by a company. Email: [contact@cut-digital.com](contact@cut-digital.com) for further information.
